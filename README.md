# vasmarfas

A personal site and a free multitool in one app. One Kotlin Multiplatform / Compose Multiplatform
codebase builds the site on WebAssembly ([vasmarfas.com](https://vasmarfas.com),
[vasmarfas.ru](https://vasmarfas.ru)) and native apps for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS and Linux.

## What is inside

A profile page with contacts, projects, articles and a CV, and a catalogue of offline tools in 18
categories with search and recents. In the apps the first tab is Home. On first start the app asks
what you do and what you are into and puts the matching tools there. The site keeps favourites
instead. Anything that can be computed locally runs everywhere. Network tools and sensors work where
the OS provides them, and the catalogue shows which platforms each tool runs on.

Texts come in Russian and English and switch instantly. The profile content is data rather than code:
`profile.json` and `resume.json` ship inside the app and are refreshed from the network at startup,
so the site and installed apps pick up changes without a release.
