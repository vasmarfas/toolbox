## Mozilla Public License 2.0

**Mediabunny** and **@mediabunny/mp3-encoder** — Copyright (c) Vanilagy. The website loads both
unmodified from its own `vendor/` folder on first use of a media tool. Source code:
<https://github.com/Vanilagy/mediabunny>. License text: <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/>.

## GNU Lesser General Public License

**FFmpeg** 8.1, in the LGPL build published by the JavaCPP Presets (`org.bytedeco:ffmpeg`), ships
with desktop builds as separate executables that the app starts as processes. The codec libraries
that build links in are covered by their own licenses, listed in the FFmpeg configuration of the
presets. FFmpeg source: <https://ffmpeg.org/download.html>. Build scripts:
<https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/tree/master/ffmpeg>. License text:
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html>.

**LAME**, compiled to WebAssembly inside `@mediabunny/mp3-encoder`, is licensed under the LGPL 2.0
or later. It runs only on the website, in its own module. Source: <https://lame.sourceforge.io>.

## SIL Open Font License 1.1

**Liberation Fonts** 2.1.5 — Digitized data copyright (c) 2010 Google Corporation, with Reserved
Font Arimo, Tinos and Cousine. Copyright (c) 2012 Red Hat, Inc., with Reserved Font Name Liberation.
The fonts under `shared/src/commonMain/composeResources/files/fonts` are cut down to Latin, Cyrillic
and punctuation and renamed Toolbox, as the license requires of modified versions. They are used
only to typeset PDF files, which embed subsets of them. The license text sits next to them in
`OFL.txt`.

## CC0 1.0

**minimp3** by lieff, <https://github.com/lieff/minimp3>. The Huffman tables and the analysis
window of the MP3 encoder in `Mp3Tables.kt` were taken from it. The encoder itself is not a port.

## BSD 3-Clause

**Skia** — Copyright (c) 2011 Google Inc. Ships as a native binary inside Skiko; see
<https://github.com/google/skia/blob/main/LICENSE>.

## Not open-source licenses

**Firebase Analytics** (`com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics`, which pulls in
`play-services-measurement`) is distributed under the Android Software Development Kit License
Agreement, <https://developer.android.com/studio/terms>. It permits building and distributing
applications; it is not covered by this project's own license, and anyone building from source
obtains it directly from Google on those terms.

**Bundled Java runtime.** Desktop installers produced by `jpackage` embed an Eclipse Temurin 21
runtime image, licensed under GPLv2 with the Classpath Exception,
<https://openjdk.org/legal/gplv2+ce.html>. The exception is what permits bundling it with an
application under different terms.

## Ported benchmark code

The benchmark tool contains Kotlin ports of three reference implementations, kept faithful so the
scores stay comparable with published ones:

- **Whetstone** — from the netlib C source, <https://netlib.org/benchmark/whetstone.c>, itself a
  translation of the Curnow and Wichmann ALGOL original (1976). Public domain.
- **Linpack** — from the netlib Java version by Jack Dongarra and co-authors,
  <https://netlib.org/benchmark/linpackjava/>. Public domain.
- **SciMark 2.0** — from the NIST ANSI C sources, <https://math.nist.gov/scimark>. Work of the
  U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology and not subject to copyright in the
  United States.

The SHA-256, memory-copy and Mandelbrot kernels beside them are not ports of anything and are not
standard benchmarks.

## Development-only

**JUnit 4** (`junit:junit`) is used for tests under the Eclipse Public License 1.0,
<https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html>. It is a test dependency and is not present in any
published build.

**Apache Commons Imaging** checks the image codecs in the desktop tests under the Apache License
2.0 and is not present in any published build either.

## Website

vasmarfas.com and vasmarfas.ru load Yandex Metrica from `mc.yandex.ru`. It is a hosted service
called over the network, not a library bundled into the site.
